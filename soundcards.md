# Soundcard status for PiDeck

Based on our tests so far, these are the soundcards known to work, those which potentially could work, and those which will not be supported by the PiDeck project. We make no promises about the performance of soundcards we have not personally tested!

A feature matrix is provided below to help you choose the soundcard which is right for your PiDeck. Some of these are current hardware, others are discontinued or obsolete models. Recycling is encouraged! :recycle: :sunglasses:

Please note that xwax supports up to three decks, and single deck USB soundcards can be combined to provide additional decks. This is not currently the case for single deck I²S soundcards such as the audioinjector.net stereo and Fe-Pi Audio HATs, due the two-channel limit of the Raspberry Pi I²S implementation.

Most full duplex soundcards have stereo line input and output. If a soundcard only supports line input, you will need an additional hardware pre-amp to use phono input. This pre-amp does not need to be very high quality for control vinyl (timecode) use. A basic DJ mixer with phono pre-amps can be used for testing a single vinyl deck. If you have a classic turntable with an earth wire, you will also need a grounding stud on the soundcard or preamp to reduce hum. Software pre-amps are not recommended for use with timecode, as their gain (being post-input) is sometimes not clean enough for a pure signal.  

Some USB phono interfaces are not full duplex and do not feature a line output from the CPU, even though the hardware features line output sockets, such as turntables and pre-amps with built in USB which are meant for recording only. The line outputs are routed from the built-in pre-amp, not the USB interface. These recording interfaces sometimes have fixed input gain which is not meant for DJs, as fast scratches and backspins can cause signal peaks which distort timecode. In these cases it is better to use the line output of the turntable into a full duplex soundcard with input level adjustment.

If you play any analogue vinyl or regular CDs without timecode, you will benefit from a hardware bypass or input mix control which enables you to play through without loss of quality, or disconnecting cables.
